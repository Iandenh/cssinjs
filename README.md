### JSS Landing

Landing page for JSS. Build with webpack, react, jss and some other cool things :)

#### TODO:

- Change links url like `href="./performance.md"` to absolute path in all repos, connected with this landing page.
- Fix internal links in docs. For e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cssinjs/jss/master/docs/js-api.md - first 3 links are not working.
- We need to do something with examples section. It looks like something horrible. Maybe just add styles, similar to current JSS landing site.
- Walk throught all pages and change headings to right ones (e.g. on some pages there are a lot of H2)
- Remove from plugin pages JSS logo. Is inutile widget. We know that is JSS :)
